# Javascript Unit Testing with Jasmine

## Running the tests

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You do not need to be running
a web server. All files needed to run the application/tests are already
included in the project.

## Notes

I installed a couple of typings files using `NPM` in order to have
code completion in VS Code but they are not needed to run the tests.
